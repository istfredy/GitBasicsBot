# Git Basics Bot

This project is a boot telegram that asks questions about the theme of Git and Github.
Directly linked to the personalized documentation that I have written and which is available on [th3fr3dy.me/gitbasics](https://th3fr3dy.me/gitbasics)

The bot awaits the user response, checks its precision and goes to the following question if the answer is correct.

## How it works

The bot uses the [Python-Telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) to interact with the telegram API.
It maintains a list of questions and answers, with the possibility of modifying or extending them according to your needs.
You can start the bot and launch the command **/start **.

## What I learned

I learned to set up a **conversation management system** in the Bot cat.
And I also learned to make a project modular and usable by other SWEs.
In suppliance of small guides and documentation like this.
